Wiz Lighting Bulb Control App
======

### This app was written in electron.js for controlling Philips Wiz light bulbs.

The bulb uses UDP protocol. The app listen for the UDP packets and also sends them to do the needful action.

The app is pretty much a replica of the android app featureset! There might be some bugs running this as a exported package! Because I had paused development suddenly.
